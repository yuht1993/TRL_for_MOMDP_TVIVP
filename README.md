# TRL_for_MOMDP_TVIVP
### This repostory contains codes and test results of a proposed TRL approach for solving mixed observerble Markov decision process with time-varying interval-valued parameters. ALl the test results of TRL and benchmarks are recoreded in the Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb). 

### Due to file upload size limitations, we have stored the offline training results of the neural network population on a cloud drive. For specific details, please refer to the following link:

### To train the network population offline, please execute the codes in following files：

“exp1/DRL_uncertainty_result.ipynb”

“exp1/DRL_out_of_sample.ipynb”

“exp2/Offline_stage_4patch.ipynb”	

“exp2/Offline_stage_8patch.ipynb”

“exp2/Offline_stage_12patch.ipynb”

“exp2/Offline_stage_16patch.ipynb”

“exp2/Offline_stage_20patch.ipynb”

“exp2/Offline_stage_24patch.ipynb”

“exp3/Offline_stage_low.ipynb”

“exp3/Offline_stage_high.ipynb”



### To test the performance of TRL, please download the training results from the cloud drive and untar them to the directions: 

"exp1/result" 

"exp2/result" 

"exp3/result" 

### or execute the code in following files after the offline network training：

“exp1/TRL_uncertainty_result.ipynb”

“exp1/TRL_out_of_sample.ipynb”

“exp2/Test_online_4patch.ipynb”

“exp2/Test_online_8patch.ipynb”
